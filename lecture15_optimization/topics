Start with task of writing prime number generator function in python
    - Explain profiling and use with this function as motivation (cProfile)
    - Use %timeit / %time also to check
    - Explain xrange briefly and show performance increase
    - Explain python built-in optimizations (vectorize!)

Introduce to C language & Cython
    - Make primes.pyx in Cython
    - Make primes.c in C
    - Run & Compare timings
